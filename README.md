## A Brief Tour of Elixir

Code and presentation for my talk at λ Rochester ➔ Functional + Programming

http://www.meetup.com/%CE%BB-Rochester-Functional-Programming-Language-Meetup/events/227261847/

## Abstract

Elixir is a functional and concurrent programming language that runs
on the Erlang VM.  My goal in this talk is to show you some of the
features of Elixir (and the Erlang VM) and share my enthusiasm for
working with it, informed by my experience using it production at
Simpli.fi.  I'll cover language features including immutability,
pattern matching, streams, macros, and type annotation.  I'll also
demonstrate some of the core features that come baked-in with the
Erlang VM, such as shared nothing concurrency, fault tolerance,
ability to attach a REPL to live processes, and distributability.
This talk will include some examples of solving problems using
light-weight processes and the actor model.

## Installing Elixir

If you have OS X, you should be able to just `brew install elixir`.

Or, [official Elixir installation instructions](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html).
